Write a Java program to print the Fibonacci series up to n terms using a for loop.
The Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
If n = 6, the series would be: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.

Input: 6
Output: Fibonacci Series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5




public class Fibonacci {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 6;
        int first = 0, second = 1;
        System.out.print("Fibonacci Series: ");
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(first);
            if (i < n - 1) {
                System.out.print(", ");
            }
            int next = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = next;
        }
    }
}
