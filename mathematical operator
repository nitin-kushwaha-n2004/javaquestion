Write a program that takes two numbers and a mathematical operator (+, -, *, /, %, <<, >>, &, |, ^) from the user and evaluates the expression following operator precedence rules.

Example:
Input: 5 * 2 + 10 / 2
Output: 15
Explanation: (5 * 2) + (10 / 2) = 10 + 5 = 15





public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = 5 * 2 + 10 / 2;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
