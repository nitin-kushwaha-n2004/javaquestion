Problem Description:

Write a program to swap two integer variables without using a temporary variable.

Input: a = 5, b = 10
Output: a = 10, b = 5

Explanation:
The program swaps the values of a and b using arithmetic or bitwise operations, resulting in a being 10 and b being 5.




public class SwapVariables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5, b = 10;
        
        a = a + b;
        b = a - b;
        a = a - b;
        
        System.out.println("a = " + a + ", b = " + b);
    }
}
