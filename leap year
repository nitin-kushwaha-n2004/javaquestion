Write a Java program to check if a given year is a leap year or not using an if-else construct. A year is a leap year if:
It is divisible by 4.
But not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

Input: 2024
Output: 2024 is a Leap Year.





import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int year = scanner.nextInt();
        
        if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
            System.out.println(year + " is a Leap Year.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(year + " is not a Leap Year.");
        }
    }
}
